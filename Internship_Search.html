      <h2>Start With Your End Goal In Mind</h2>
      <p>Not sure what that end goal may be? Well, without a clear focus other students have indicated that the job/internship searching can feel overwhelming. Before you link to a job/internship posting board, consider answering these questions to guide your search:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What types of job/internship are you looking for? What industries are you interested in? What keywords will help you find those opportunities?
        <ul>
          <li>Pro-tip: Join a <a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/careertracks">UCC Career Track </a>to learn about industry-specific events, jobs, and trends.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Are there any organizations that you already know you want to target? </li>
     </ul>
      <p>As you start thinking about organizations of interest, download our job search template to keep track (keep scrolling for more tips on how to use this doc!)</p>
      <P>Not sure about any of these questions or how to fit the pieces of the puzzle fit together? Schedule an exploring options <a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/contact/makeappointment">appointment</a> with a UCC Career Coach.</P>

     <h2>First Things First: Prepare Your Resume, Cover Letter, And More</h2>
      <p>Once the ball starts rolling on your search, you’ll need to be able to quickly showcase your qualifications to employers and connections. As you begin your search, you’ll want to have:</p>
      <ul><li><a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/resume-resources">Resumes</a><ul>
          <li>You’ll eventually end up tailoring your resumes to specific jobs, but creating your resume early or freshening up an existing resume makes things easier when it’s time to apply. Once you feel confident with your draft, you can use it as a foundation to then tailor it to the different roles to which you are applying.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/content/cover-letter-resources">Cover Letters</a>
        <ul><li>Cover Letters aren’t always required, but getting familiar with what to include before you start applying can help you easily create one when it is required. Even when not required, if there is an option to submit one and it is an organization you are interested in, expressing that interest in a cover letter that highlights your skills and experiences can go a long way.</li></ul>
        </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Digital Profiles
        <ul><li>Your digital “brand” is important in this virtual environment. You’ll want to make sure your online and social media profiles are complete and showcase you well when employers are searching online for candidates. By freshening up your profiles, these tools can start working for you by notifying you of targeted job postings recommendations and connections. We recommend starting with profiles on <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://umich.joinhandshake.com/">Handshake</a>, <a href="http://umich.peoplegrove.com/">UCAN</a>.</li></ul>
      </ul>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/interviewing-resources">Interviews</a>
        <ul>
         <li>​Plan ahead! Interviewing is a SKILL -- you want to get good at it! Interviews can be scheduled on short timelines in a search process, so get ahead of the game by preparing and practicing. </li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The UCC coaches are here to support you with all your preparation for interviews, resumes, cover letters, sharpening your online tools like LinkedIn, and learning tips to best leverage Handshake. Make an appointment for more help.</p>

      <h2>Develop A Plan To Get And Stay Organized</h2>
      <p>The best advice other students have shared is to start early when looking for a job/internship: National statistics show that most searches take 3-6 months. Make the most of your time by developing a strategy that allows you to maximize the time you have available.<br>Resist the urge to spend all of your time dropping the same resume into large job posting boards. That’s not a job/internship search! Recent studies indicate between 60-70% of jobs are obtained through word of mouth/<a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/content/networking-resources">networking</a>.<br>Now, this doesn’t mean you should ignore job boards- use those too (with a tailored resume!). Organize your search with our <a href="https://umich.joinhandshake.com/edu/articles/31804">job search template</a>: <br>You’ll end up with three crucial tabs: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizations to Target
        <ul>
          <li>Create a list of 30-40 organizations you want to target. This is your “prospect list”. Pick a few at a time to focus on and continue to work through your list. Go to the organizations’ websites to see if they are hiring and at the same time learn more about them. Reach out to U-M alumni at the organization for an <a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/article/networking-resources">informational interview</a>. You always want to learn more about the organization and how to stand out as a top candidate for their positions.</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Contacts
        <ul>
          <li>Search <a href="http://umich.peoplegrove.com/">UCAN</a> and <a href="http://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> for alumni who can help you navigate your search and give you insight into their organization or industry. Track your outreach so you remember when to check back in with them and (send a thank you note!). So many people are excited when college students reach out and they are more than willing to talk and be helpful (especially alumni from Michigan!)</li>
        </ul></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Applications
        <ul><li>Track your applications in one place so you never miss a deadline. Check on applications that you haven’t received any feedback on to see where those organizations are in their processes and express your continued interest.</li></ul>
      </ul>
      <p>Consider using alerts on your calendar or phone to remind you about application deadlines. <br>Meet with UCC Career Coaches for a <a href="https://umich.joinhandshake.com/appointments/new/">job search appointment or internship lab</a> if you find yourself at a standstill, need help generating more options, or have other questions!</p>

      <h2>The More People You Talk To, The Closer You Will Get To An Opportunity -- It’s Networking!</h2>
      <p><a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/content/networking-resources">Networking</a> is the single most effective way to optimize your job search. Don’t get stuck in a rut spending hours everyday hitting “submit” on job boards. By networking you gain access to people who can give you advice, help you navigate how to be successful, share with you opportunities they hear about, and sometimes get you connected to other professionals so you can keep expanding your connections! </p>
      <br><p>U-M alumni are an excellent place to start:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://umich.peoplegrove.com/">UCAN</a>- University Career Alumni Network has thousands of alumni volunteers who are willing to talk with you, answer your career questions and offer their advice.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/university-of-michigan/people/">LinkedIn U-M Alumni Tool</a>LinkedIn U-M Alumni Tool- LinkedIn has over 300,000+ U-M alumni on the platform. There you can find alumni in every industry and in thousands of organizations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also network through Handshake by checking out the  <a href="https://umich.joinhandshake.com/edu/events">employer events.</a></p>

      <h2>Who’s Hiring? See An Interesting Job? Now Apply!</h2>
      <p>Apply online to current openings found on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Organizational websites- Most organizations have a “careers” page for you to view current openings (and sometimes recruiter contact information which allows you to reach out in another way by sending your resume directly to that person!)</li>
        <li><a href="http://umich.joinhandshake.com/">Handshake</a>- The UCC sponsored job board with thousands of postings specifically for U-M students.  To get the best results, make sure your <a href="https://umich.joinhandshake.com/my_career_interests">Career Interests</a> are up-to-date.</li>
        <li>Broad job/internship boards- The two most popular are <a href="http://go.indeed.com/JobSearchAcademy-UMich">Indeed</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/">LinkedIn.</a> Use one of these to find out about opportunities at organizations you don’t already have on your prospect list.</li>
        <li>Industry specific job boards- Talk to people in your desired industry (hint: use alumni in <a href="http://umich.peoplegrove.com/">UCAN!</a>) to find out where jobs for specific industries are posted. For example, government jobs use <a href="http://usajobs.gov/">USAJobs.gov</a> and many nonprofit organizations use <a href="http://idealist.org/">Idealist.</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://interstride.com/umich/">Interstride-</a> This platform supports students who are seeking opportunities in the US and in other countries. Country insights resources are available to find job opportunities, cost of living, culture, immigration, travel information and more for countries worldwide.</li>
        <li><a href="https://online.goinglobal.com/">GoinGlobal</a>- Another platform that provides career guides and postings based on countries and cities worldwide.</li>

      <h2>Build Skills and Stay Marketable</h2>
      <p>Internships aren’t the only way to build skills and explore careers! Check out some ideas below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>UCC Events: Check out the UCC’s Immersion experiences or Employer Challenges on Handshake to meet industry professionals and gain exposure to the world of work.</li>
        <li>Volunteering: Engaging with <a href="https://connect2community.umich.edu/">nonprofits and community organizations</a> allows you to build soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and leadership, all of which are highly valued by employers.
        <ul>
          <li>Curious about which other skills employers seek? Check out a list with examples by <a href="https://careercenter.umich.edu/career-readiness#CAREER">clicking here!</a></li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Online Courses: Consider courses or certifications on platforms like Coursera, Udemy, <a href="https://its.umich.edu/academics-research/teaching-learning/linkedin-learning">LinkedIn Learning</a>, or <a href="https://online.umich.edu/google-certificates">Google Career Certificates</a>. Focus on skills relevant to your field of interest.</li>
        <li>Micro-Internships or Job Simulations: Websites such as <a href="https://www.parkerdewey.com/career-launchers">Parker Dewey</a> and <a href="https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships">Forage</a> allow students and alumni to test fields of interest and gain experience through short-term projects.
        <ul>
          <li>Please note that if you are an international student, it is likely that you will need some type of work authorization to pursue a micro-internship. Please visit the International Center to see if you are qualified for OPT/CPT before engaging in a micro-internship experience.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Job Shadowing: Reach out to professionals in your area of interest through LinkedIn, <a href="https://umich.peoplegrove.com/hub/ucan/home-v3">UCAN</a>, or email and inquire about shadowing opportunities. This experience provides insight into day-to-day operations in your desired field and can help you build your network.</li>
        <li>Personal Projects: Start a project on your own or with a team, such as developing a website or social media channel, or creating a portfolio of art, writing, or coding projects. It’s a great way to show initiative and build a body of work that can impress future employers.</li>
        <li>Networking: Attend industry conferences, webinars, or local meetups. Set up Informational Interviews with alumni through <a href="https://umich.peoplegrove.com/hub/ucan/home-v3">UCAN</a>. Engaging with professionals can provide career insights and open doors for future opportunities.</li>
