      <h2>Section 1: What is Networking is Building Relationships? </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Leverage your circle of friends, family, professors, previous employers, and the University of Michigan Alumni.</li>
            <li>Be curious about the person you are connecting with to learn more about their career. Networking isn’t about winning people over or asking for a job. </li>
            <li>We recommend asking for informational interviews, which are short meetings or calls with someone in a field of interest to learn more about their job, their industry, their career pathway, and to hear their advice. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Section 2: How Do I Start Networking?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To get started with networking:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare for networking by polishing your resume, practicing your elevator pitch, and generating questions to ask during informational interviews.</li>
            <li>Identify people to reach out to to build your community. </li>
            <li>Make contact to ask for a time to connect. Ask for an informational interview, not a job. Informational interviews are about asking professionals questions to learn more about their pathways, their profession, and/or industry, and to get their advice. </li>
