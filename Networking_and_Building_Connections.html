            <li>Be curious about the person you are connecting with to learn more about their career. Networking isn’t about winning people over or asking for a job. </li>
            <li>We recommend asking for informational interviews, which are short meetings or calls with someone in a field of interest to learn more about their job, their industry, their career pathway, and to hear their advice. </li>

        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare for networking by polishing your resume, practicing your elevator pitch, and generating questions to ask during informational interviews.</li>
            <li>Identify people to reach out to to build your community. </li>
            <li>Make contact to ask for a time to connect. Ask for an informational interview, not a job. Informational interviews are about asking professionals questions to learn more about their pathways, their profession, and/or industry, and to get their advice.

      <p>Subject: UMSI BSI Student Seeking Your Advice</p>
      <p> Dear Mr. Johnson, </p>
      <p>My name is Alexis, and I will be a senior in the UMSI BSI program at U-M this fall. I’m interested in learning more about careers in UX research, and I saw on LinkedIn that you currently work in UX Research at Google. As an alum, I know your perspective about your current role and the steps you took to get there would be very helpful. </p>
      <p>I would be happy to meet via phone or Zoom. I know this may be a busy time, so if we aren’t able to meet within the next two weeks, I’ll be sure to check back in to see if sometime later this summer would work better. </p>
      <p>Thank you so much, </p>
      <p>Alexis</p>
